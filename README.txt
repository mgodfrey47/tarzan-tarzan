TARZAN TARZAN

This script was written for playing the game Tarzan Tarzan remotely over Zoom.

For the rules of the game, see TarzanTarzan-rules.docx


Before play, edit the PEOPLE and THINGS variables in TarzanTarzan.m to contain the players' names and characters respectively.

Important: ensure that the characters are entered in the same player order as the names.


To begin the game, run TarzanTarzan.m. This will open a window showing the players names arranged in a circle, with their associated character below.

If a player makes a mistake, use the drop down list in the bottom right corner of the window to select the character they are currently associated with. Then click the 'Go to the end' button below. This will move the player who made the mistake to the bottom position and all players below them one place clockwise.

If a player was sent to the end erroneously, use the undo button in the bottom left corner to reverse the last change.
